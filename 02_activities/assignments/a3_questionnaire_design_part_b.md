# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?
The sample quality is reasonably robust, given the stratified random sampling strategy. This approach helps ensure representation across departments experiencing high turnover, 
addressing potential undercoverage bias. However, representativeness could still be impacted by nonresponse bias, as individuals who leave due to dissatisfaction might avoid 
participating. Similarly, recall bias could influence responses from former employees reflecting on their experience. While stratification helps ensure coverage, sampling frame 
completeness (e.g., accurate and up-to-date contact information for departed employees) remains a critical factor.
    
    

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.
Updated Survey:

1. How satisfied were you with your role at the company before considering leaving? (Scale: 1â€“5)
Unchanged as it remains clear and concise.

2. Which of the following factors influenced your decision to leave or think about leaving? (Choose all that apply: Pay, Career growth, Work-life balance, Relationship with management, 
Company culture, Job satisfaction, Otherâ€”please specify)
Added "please specify" to "Other" for better measurement completeness.

3. How well did you feel supported by your manager in achieving your professional goals? (Options: Very supported, Somewhat supported, Neutral, Somewhat unsupported, Very unsupported)
Unchanged as it provides actionable insights.

4. How effective was the companyâ€™s communication and transparency on important issues? (Options: Very effective, Somewhat effective, Neutral, Somewhat ineffective, Very ineffective)
Unchanged as it directly addresses key organizational factors.

5. Did you feel there was a clear path for career advancement within the company? (Options: Yes, Somewhat, No)
Unchanged for simplicity and relevance.

6. How often did you feel stressed or overloaded by your workload? (Options: Always, Often, Sometimes, Rarely, Never)
Revised wording to ensure neutrality: "How often did you feel your workload was manageable?"

7. What changes do you think the company could make to improve job satisfaction and reduce turnover?
Added an instruction: "Be as specific as possible for actionable feedback."

8. Would you recommend the company to others as a good place to work? (Options: Yes, No, Not sure)
Revised options: Yes, No, Maybeâ€”to reduce forced-choice bias.

9.How satisfied were you with the companyâ€™s benefits and compensation? (Scale: 1â€“5)
Unchanged.



3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?
No, the purpose of the survey could not have been effectively fulfilled through an observational study. Observational studies are limited in understanding employee intent, 
motivations, and subjective experiences, key aspects for addressing turnover. Surveys are essential for capturing qualitative insights, such as reasons for dissatisfaction or 
recommendations for improvement, which cannot be inferred purely through observational data.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
The goal of this survey is to understand why entry- and lower-level employees are leaving the company and identify specific areas where we can make improvements to boost job satisfaction and reduce turnover.

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

Sampling Frame: A list of current entry- and lower-level employees, along with those who left within the last six months.
Sampling Units: Individual employees in entry- and lower-level positions.
Sampling Strategy: Weâ€™ll use a stratified random sample to make sure weâ€™re hearing from employees across all departments facing high turnover.
Observational units : are the individual employees in entry- and lower-level positions who either currently work at the company or have recently left.
